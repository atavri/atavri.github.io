        As a scientist and educator, I am fascinated by the physical processes that shape the polar oceans –
        especially the dynamic marginal ice zone where sea ice meets open water. My research focuses on sea ice
        geophysics and wave–ice interactions, using microwave remote sensing to improve how these processes are
        represented in climate models.

      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I have always been drawn to understanding the physical processes of the ocean surface and how they can be observed
        from space. My work bridges satellite remote sensing, field campaigns, and coupled climate models to study
        the polar oceans, with a focus on the ice edge, where waves and open water alter sea ice dynamics. I aim to
        build connections between detailed physical processes and their representation in climate models, using
        microwave sensors to study sea ice variability and wave–ice–ocean interactions. Outside
        of research, I enjoy mentoring, teaching, and working across disciplines to explore the complexity of our planet.
