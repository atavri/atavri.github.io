        <h2>From Sea-Ice Floes to the Ice Pack</h2>
        <p>
          Sea ice regulates exchanges of heat, momentum, and freshwater between ocean and atmosphere.
          I study variability from the floe scale (surface roughness, melt ponds, snow) to basin scale,
          with emphasis on the marginal ice zone (MIZ) where breakup and waves drive lateral melt and mixing.
          Understanding these multi-scale processes is essential for both retrieval accuracy and climate feedbacks.

        <h2>Microwave Scattering Across Melt Transitions</h2>
        <p>
          Melt ponds complicate passive-microwave retrievals. I use polarimetric SAR (C- and L-band)
          to separate surface and volume scattering through the melt season, extending the usable window
          of remote-sensing climate records and clarifying ambiguous signatures.

          <li>C-band tracks early pond onset via surface scattering; L-band captures volumetric contrasts during drainage.</li>
          <li>Field validation (e.g., MOSAiC) links SAR polarimetry to observed pond evolution, albedo, and energy flux.</li>
          <li>Future work: exploit higher-frequency missions (e.g., SWOT Ka-band) to quantify roughness and subsurface structure.</li>

        <h2>Diagnosing Biases in Passive-Microwave SIC</h2>
        <p>
          Passive-microwave sea-ice concentration (SIC) products diverge most in the MIZ and melt season.
          I’m developing a diagnostic framework that forward-emulates brightness temperatures (Tb) from model SIC
          and compares them with AMSR2/SSMIS observations to identify regime-dependent algorithmic biases.

        <h2>Turbulence, Waves, and Ice–Ocean Coupling</h2>
        <p>
          Using neXtSIM–WaveWatch III and related tools, I assess how wind–wave misalignment and partial ice cover
          shape vertical kinetic energy and mixing in the ocean surface boundary layer, including the role of
          Langmuir turbulence under sea-ice cover.
